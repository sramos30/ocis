* Bugfix - Ensure the same data on /ocs/v?.php/config like oC10: [#3113](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3113)

   We've fixed the returned values on the /ocs/v?.php/config endpoints, so that they now return
   the same values as an oC10 would do.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3113

* Bugfix - Use the default server download protocol if spaces are not supported: [#3386](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3386)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3386

* Change - Fix keys with underscores in the config files: [#3412](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3412)

   We've fixed some config keys in configuration files that previously didn't contain
   underscores but should.

   Please check the documentation on https://owncloud.dev for latest configuration
   documentation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3412

* Enhancement - Add sorting to GraphAPI users and groups: [#3360](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/3360)

   The GraphAPI endpoints for users and groups support ordering now. User can be ordered by
   displayName, onPremisesSamAccountName and mail. Groups can be ordered by displayName.

   Example: https://localhost:9200/graph/v1.0/groups?$orderby=displayName asc

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/3360

* Enhancement - Make config dir configurable: [#3440](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3440)

   We have added an `OCIS_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable the will take precedence over the
   default `/etc/ocis`, `~/.ocis` and `.config` locations. When it is set the default locations
   will be ignored and only the configuration files in that directory will be read.

   We now show the same resoucre id for resources when accessing them via a public links as when
   using a logged in user. This allows the web ui to start a WOPI session with the correct resource
   id.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3349

* Change - Add remote item to mountpoint and fix spaceID: [#3365](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3365)

   A mountpoint represents the mounted share on the share receivers side. The original resource
   is located where the grant has been set. This item is now shown as libregraph remoteItem on the
   mountpoint. While adding this, we fixed the spaceID for mountpoints.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3365

* Change - Switch NATS backend: [#3192](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3192)

   We've switched the NATS backend from Streaming to JetStream, since NATS Streaming is
   depreciated.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3192
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/2574

* Change - Drop json config file support: [#3366](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3366)

   We've remove the support to configure oCIS and it's service with a json file. From now on we only
   support yaml configuration files, since they have the possibility to add comments.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3366

* Change - Settings service now stores its data via metadata service: [#3232](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3232)

   Instead of writing files to disk it will use metadata service to do so

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3232

* Enhancement - Audit logger will now log file events: [#3332](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3332)

   See full list of supported events in `audit/pkg/types/types.go`

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3332

* Enhancement - Improve thumbnails API: [#3272](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3272)

   Changed the thumbnails API to no longer transfer images via GRPC. GRPC has a limited message
   size and isn't very efficient with large binary data. The new API transports the images over
   HTTP.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3272

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6471

* Bugfix - Make events settings configurable: [#3214](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3214)

   We've fixed the hardcoded events settings to be configurable.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3214

* Bugfix - Align storage metadata GPRC bind port with other variable names: [#3169](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3169)

   Changed STORAGE_METADATA_GRPC_PROVIDER_ADDR to STORAGE_METADATA_GRPC_ADDR so it aligns
   with standard environment variable naming conventions used in oCIS.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3169

* Change - Unify file IDs: [#3185](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3185)

   We changed the file IDs to be consistent across all our APIs (WebDAV, LibreGraph, OCS). We
   removed the base64 encoding. Now they are formatted like <storageID>!<opaqueID>. They are
   using a reserved character ``!`` as a URL safe separator.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3185

   We added the OData query param "orderBy" for listing spaces. We can now order by Space Name and
   LastModifiedDateTime.

   Example 1:
   https://localhost:9200/graph/v1.0/me/drives/?$orderby=lastModifiedDateTime desc
   Example 2: https://localhost:9200/graph/v1.0/me/drives/?$orderby=name asc

* Enhancement - Change NATS port: [#3210](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3210)

   Currently only a certain range of ports is allowed for ocis application. Use a supported port
   for nats server

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3210

* Enhancement - Re-Enabling web cache control: [#3109](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3109)

   We've re-enable browser caching headers (`Expires` and `Last-Modified`) for the web
   service, this was disabled due to a problem in the fileserver used before. Since we're now using
   our own fileserver implementation this works again and is enabled by default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3109

* Enhancement - Add SPA conform fileserver for web: [#3109](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3109)

   We've added an SPA conform fileserver to the web service. It enables web to use vue's history
   mode and behaves like nginx try_files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3109

* Enhancement - Implement notifications service: [#3217](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3217)

* Bugfix - Use same jwt secret for accounts as for metadata storage: [#3081](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3081)

   We've the metadata storage uses the same jwt secret as all other REVA services. Therefore the
   accounts service needs to use the same secret.

   Secrets are documented here:
   https://owncloud.dev/ocis/deployment/#change-default-secrets

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3081

* Bugfix - Make the default grpc client use the registry settings: [#3041](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3041)

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix claim selector based routing for basic auth: [#2779](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2779)

   We've fixed the claim selector based routing for requests using basic auth. Previously
   requests using basic auth have always been routed to the DefaultPolicy when using the claim
   selector despite the set cookie because the basic auth middleware fakes some OIDC claims.

   Now the cookie is checked before routing to the DefaultPolicy and therefore set cookie will
   also be respected for requests using basic auth.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2779

* Bugfix - Disallow creation of a group with empty name via the OCS api: [#2825](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2825)

   We've fixed the behavior for group creation on the OCS api, where it was possible to create a
   group with an empty name. This was is not possible on oC10 and is therefore also forbidden on oCIS
   to keep compatibility. This PR forbids the creation and also ensures the correct status code
   for both OCS v1 and OCS v2 apis.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2823
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2825

* Bugfix - Fix using s3ng as the metadata storage backend: [#2807](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2807)

   It is now possible to use s3ng as the metadata storage backend.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2668
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2807

* Bugfix - Use the CS3api up- and download workflow for the accounts service: [#2837](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2837)

   We've fixed the interaction of the accounts service with the metadata storage after bypassing
   the InitiateUpload and InitiateDownload have been removed from various storage drivers. The
   accounts service now uses the proper CS3apis workflow for up- and downloads.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2837
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/2309

* Change - Rename `APP_PROVIDER_BASIC_*` environment variables: [#2812](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2812)

   We've renamed the `APP_PROVIDER_BASIC_*` to `APP_PROVIDER_*` since the `_BASIC_` part is a
   copy and paste error. Now all app provider environment variables are consistently starting
   with `APP_PROVIDER_*`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2812
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2811

* Change - Restructure Configuration Parsing: [#2708](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2708)

   Tags: ocis

   CLI flags are no longer needed for subcommands, as we rely solely on env variables and config
   files. This greatly simplifies configuration and deployment.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2708

* Change - OIDC: fallback if IDP doesn't provide "preferred_username" claim: [#2644](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2644)

   Some IDPs don't add the "preferred_username" claim. Fallback to the "email" claim in that case

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2644

* Enhancement - Cleanup ocis-pkg config: [#2813](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2813)

   Certain values were of no use when configuring the ocis runtime.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2813

* Enhancement - Correct shutdown of services under runtime: [#2843](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2843)

   Supervised goroutines now shut themselves down on context cancellation propagation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2843

* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.17.0: [#2849](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2849)

   Updated REVA to v1.17.0 This update includes:

* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.16.0: [#2737](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2737)

## Details

* Bugfix - Don't allow empty password: [#197](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/197)

   It was allowed to create users with empty or spaces-only password. This is fixed

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/197

* Bugfix - Fix basic auth config: [#2719](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2719)

   Users could authenticate using basic auth even though `PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH` was set to
   false.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2466
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2719

* Bugfix - Fix basic auth with custom user claim: [#2755](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2755)

   We've fixed authentication with basic if oCIS is configured to use a non-standard claim as user
   claim (`PROXY_USER_OIDC_CLAIM`). Prior to this bugfix the authentication always failed and
   is now working.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2755

* Bugfix - Fix oCIS startup ony systems with IPv6: [#2698](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2698)

   We've fixed failing startup of oCIS on systems with IPv6 addresses.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2300
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2698

* Bugfix - Fix opening images in media viewer for some usernames: [#2738](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2738)

   We've fixed the opening of images in the media viewer for user names containing special
   characters (eg. `@`) which will be URL-escaped. Before this fix users could not see the image in
   the media viewer. Now the user name is correctly escaped and the user can view the image in the
   media viewer.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2738

* Bugfix - Fix error logging when there is no thumbnail for a file: [#2702](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2702)

   We've fixed the behavior of the logging when there is no thumbnail for a file (because the
   filetype is not supported for thumbnail generation). Previously the WebDAV service always
   issues an error log in this case. Now, we don't log this event any more.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2702

* Bugfix - Don't announce resharing via capabilities: [#2690](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2690)

   OCIS / Reva is not capable of resharing, yet. We've set the resharing capability to false, so
   that clients have a chance to react accordingly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2690

* Change - Make all insecure options configurable and change the default to false: [#2700](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2700)

   We had several hard-coded 'insecure' flags. These options are now configurable and default to
   false. Also we changed all other 'insecure' flags with a previous default of true to false.

   In development environments using self signed certs (the default) you now need to set these
   flags:

   ``` PROXY_OIDC_INSECURE=true STORAGE_FRONTEND_APPPROVIDER_INSECURE=true
   STORAGE_FRONTEND_ARCHIVER_INSECURE=true STORAGE_FRONTEND_OCDAV_INSECURE=true
   STORAGE_HOME_DATAPROVIDER_INSECURE=true
   STORAGE_METADATA_DATAPROVIDER_INSECURE=true STORAGE_OIDC_INSECURE=true
   STORAGE_USERS_DATAPROVIDER_INSECURE=true THUMBNAILS_CS3SOURCE_INSECURE=true
   THUMBNAILS_WEBDAVSOURCE_INSECURE=true ```

   As an alternative you also can set a single flag, which configures all options together:

   ``` OCIS_INSECURE=true ```

## Details

* Security - Don't expose services by default: [#2612](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2612)

   We've changed the bind behaviour for all non public facing services. Before this PR all
   services would listen on all interfaces. After this PR, all services listen on 127.0.0.1 only,
   except the proxy which is listening on 0.0.0.0:9200.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2612

* Bugfix - Create parent directories for idp configuration: [#2667](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2667)

   The parent directories of the identifier-registration.yaml config file might not exist when
   starting idp. Create them, when that is the case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2667

* Change - Configurable default quota: [#2621](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2621)

   When creating a new space a (configurable) default quota will be used (instead the hardcoded
   one). One can set the EnvVar `GRAPH_SPACES_DEFAULT_QUOTA` to configure it

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2621
   https://jira.owncloud.com/browse/OCIS-2070

* Change - New default data paths and easier configuration of the data path: [#2590](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2590)

   We've changed the default data path for our release artifacts: - oCIS docker images will now
   store all data in `/var/lib/ocis` instead in `/var/tmp/ocis` - binary releases will now store
   all data in `~/.ocis` instead of `/var/tmp/ocis`

   Also if you're a developer and you run oCIS from source, it will store all data in `~/.ocis` from
   now on.

   You can now easily change the data path for all extensions by setting the environment variable
   `OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH`.

   If you want to package oCIS, you also can set the default data path at compile time, eg. by passing
   `-X "github.com/owncloud/ocis/ocis-pkg/config/defaults.BaseDataPathType=path" -X
   "github.com/owncloud/ocis/ocis-pkg/config/defaults.BaseDataPathValue=/var/lib/ocis"`
   to your go build step.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2590

* Change - Split spaces webdav url and graph url in base and path: [#2660](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2660)

   We've fixed the behavior for the spaces webdav url and graph explorer graph url settings, so
   that they respect the environment variable `OCIS_URL`. Previously oCIS admins needed to set
   these URLs manually to make spaces and the graph explorer work.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2660

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v4.4.0: [#2681](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2681)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5926
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2655

* Enhancement - Broaden bufbuild/Buf usage: [#2630](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2630)

   We've switched the usage of bufbuild/Buf from a protoc replacement only to also using it to
   confige the outputs and pinning dependencies.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2630
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2616

* Enhancement - Replace fileb0x with go-embed: [#1199](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1199)

   Go-embed already brings the functionality we need but with less code. We decided to use it
   instead of 3rd party fileb0x

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1199
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2631
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2649

   We've upgraded to go-micro v4.1.0

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2616

* Enhancement - Review and correct http header: [#2666](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2666)

   Reviewed and corrected the necessary http headers. Made CORS configurable.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2666

* Enhancement - Lower TUS max chunk size: [#2584](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2584)

   We've lowered the TUS max chunk size from infinite to 0.1GB so that chunking actually happens.

   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/2136

* Enhancement - Add sharees additional info paramater config to ocs: [#2637](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2637)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2637

* Enhancement - Add a middleware to authenticate public share requests: [#2536](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2536)

   Added a new middleware to authenticate public share requests. This makes it possible to use
   APIs which require an authenticated context with public shares.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2536
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2652

* Enhancement - Report quota states: [#2628](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2628)

   When listing the available spaces via the GraphAPI we now return quota states to make it easier
   for the clients to add visual indicators.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2628

* Enhancement - Start up a new machine auth provider in the storage service: [#2528](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2528)

   This PR also adds the config to skip encoding user groups in reva tokens

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2528
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2529

* Enhancement - Enforce permission on update space quota: [#2650](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2650)

   Added a check that only users with the `set-space-quota` permission can update the space
   quota.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2650

* Enhancement - Update lico to v0.51.1: [#2654](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2654)

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix the account resolver middleware: [#2557](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2557)

   The accounts resolver middleware put an empty token into the request when the user was already
   present. Added a step to get the token for the user.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2557

* Bugfix - Fix version information for extensions: [#2575](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2575)

   We've fixed the behavior for `ocis version` which previously always showed `0.0.0` as version
   for extensions. Now the real version of the extensions are shown.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2575

* Bugfix - Add the gatewaysvc to all shared configuration in REVA services: [#2597](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2597)

   We've fixed the configuration for REVA services which didn't have a gatewaysvc in their shared
   configuration. This could lead to default gatewaysvc addresses in the auth middleware. Now it
   is set everywhere.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2597

* Bugfix - Use proper url path decode on the username: [#2511](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2511)

   We now properly decode the username when reading it from a url parameter

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2511

* Bugfix - Remove notifications placeholder: [#2514](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2514)

   Since Reva was communicating its notification capabilities incorrectly, oCIS relied on a
   hardcoded string to overwrite them. This has been fixed in
   [reva#1819](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1819) so we now removed the hardcoded
   string and don't modify Reva's notification capabilities anymore in order to fix clients
   having to poll a (non-existent) notifications endpoint.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2514

* Bugfix - Remove asset path configuration option from proxy: [#2576](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2576)

   We've remove the asset path configuration option (`--asset-path` or `PROXY_ASSET_PATH`)
   since it didn't do anything at all.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2576

* Bugfix - Race condition in config parsing: [#2574](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2574)

   There was a race condition in the config parsing when configuring the storage services caused
   by services overwriting a pointer to a config value. We fixed it by setting sane defaults.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2574

* Change - Configure users and metadata storage separately: [#2598](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2598)

   We've fixed the configuration behaviour of the user and metadata service writing in the same
   directory when using oCIS storage.

   Therefore we needed to separate the configuration of the users and metadata storage so that
   they now can be configured totally separate.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2598

* Change - Make the drives create method odata compliant: [#2531](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2531)

   When creating a space on the graph API we now use the POST Body to provide the parameters.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2535
   https://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/#modifyData

* Change - Unify Envvar names configuring REVA gateway address: [#2587](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2587)

   We've renamed all envvars configuring REVA gateway address to `REVA_GATEWAY`, additionally
   we renamed the cli parameters to `--reva-gateway-addr` and adjusted the description

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2091
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2587

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v4.3.0: [#2589](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2589)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v4.3.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2589
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v4.3.0

* Enhancement - Updated MimeTypes configuration for AppRegistry: [#2603](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2603)

   We updated the type of the mime types config to a list, to keep the order of mime types from the
   config.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2603

* Enhancement - Add maximum files and size to archiver capabilities: [#2544](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2544)

   We added the maximum files count and maximum archive size of the archiver to the capabilities
   endpoint. Clients can use this to generate warnings before the actual archive creation fails.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2537
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2544
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/2105

* Enhancement - Reduced repository size: [#2579](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2579)

   We removed leftover artifacts from the migration to a single repository.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2579

* Enhancement - Return the newly created space: [#2610](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2610)

   Changed the response of the CreateSpace method to include the newly created space.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2610
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/2158

* Enhancement - Expose the reva archiver in OCIS: [#2509](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2509)

   The reva archiver can now be accessed through the storage frontend service

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2509

* Enhancement - Favorites capability: [#2599](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2599)

   We've added a capability for the storage frontend which can be used to announce to clients
   whether or not favorites are supported. By default this is disabled because the listing of
   favorites doesn't survive service restarts at the moment.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2599

* Enhancement - Upgrade to GO 1.17: [#2605](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2605)

   We've upgraded the used GO version from 1.16 to 1.17.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2605

* Enhancement - Make mimetype allow list configurable for app provider: [#2553](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2553)

   We've added a configuration option to configure the mimetype allow list introduced in
   cs3org/reva#2095. This also makes it possible to set one application per mime type as a
   default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2563
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2553
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/2095

* Enhancement - Add allow_creation parameter to mime type config: [#2591](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2591)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2591

* Enhancement - Add option to skip generation of demo users and groups: [#2495](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2495)

   We've added a new environment variable to decide whether we should generate the demo users and
   groups or not. This environment variable is set to `true` by default, so the demo users and
   groups will get generated by default as long as oCIS is in its "technical preview" stage.

   In any case, there are still some users and groups automatically generated: for users: Reva
   IOP, Kopano IDP, admin; for groups: sysusers and users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2495

* Enhancement - Allow overriding the cookie based route by claim: [#2508](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2508)

   When determining the routing policy we now let the claim override the cookie so that users are
   routed to the correct backend after login.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2508

* Enhancement - Redirect invalid links to oC Web: [#2493](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2493)

   Invalid links (eg. https://foo.bar/index.php/apps/pdfviewer) will be redirect to
   ownCloud Web instead of displaying a blank page with a "not found" message.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2493
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2512

* Enhancement - Use reva's Authenticate method instead of spawning token managers: [#2528](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2528)

   When using the CS3 proxy backend, we previously obtained the user from reva's userprovider
   service and minted the token ourselves. This required maintaining a shared JWT secret between
   ocis and reva, as well duplication of logic. This PR delegates this logic by using the
   `Authenticate` method provided by the reva gateway service to obtain this token, making it an
   arbitrary, indestructible entry. Currently, the changes have been made to the proxy service
   but will be extended to others as well.

* Enhancement - TLS config options for ldap in reva: [#2492](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2492)

   We added the new config options "ldap-cacert" and "ldap-insecure" to the auth-, users- and
   groups-provider services to be able to do proper TLS configuration for the LDAP clients.
   "ldap-cacert" is by default configured to add the bundled glauth LDAP servers certificate to
   the trusted set for the LDAP clients. "ldap-insecure" is set to "false" by default and can be
   used to disable certificate checks (only advisable for development and test enviroments).

   We removed a non working route from the proxy default configuration and fixed the cs3 users
   deployment example since it still used the accounts service. It now only uses the configured
   LDAP.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2474

* Bugfix - Set English as default language in the dropdown in the settings page: [#2465](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2465)

   The language dropdown didn't have a default language selected, and it was showing an empty
   value. Now it shows English instead.

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.12: [#2423](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2423)

## Details

* Bugfix - Specify primary user type for all accounts: [#2364](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2364)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2364

* Bugfix - Fix naming of the user- and groupprovider services: [#2388](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2388)

   The services are called "storage-userprovider" and "storage-groupprovider". The 'ocis
   help' output was misleading.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2388

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v4.1.0: [#2426](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2426)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v4.1.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2426
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v4.1.0

* Enhancement - Use non root user for the owncloud/ocis docker image: [#2380](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2380)

   The owncloud/ocis docker image now uses a non root user and enables you to set a different user
   with the docker `--user` parameter. The default user has the UID 1000 is part of a group with the
   GID 1000.

   This is a breaking change for existing docker deployments. The permission on the files and
   folders in persistent volumes need to be changed to the UID and GID used for oCIS (default
   1000:1000 if not changed by the user).

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2380

* Enhancement - Replace unmaintained jwt library: [#2386](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2386)

   The old library [github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go)
   is unmaintained and was replaced by the community maintained fork
   [github.com/golang-jwt/jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt).

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2386

* Enhancement - Update bleve to version 2.1.0: [#2391](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2391)

   Updated bleve to the current version.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2391

* Enhancement - Use only one go.mod file for project dependencies: [#2344](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2344)

## Details

* Bugfix - Improve IDP Login Accessibility: [#5376](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5376)

   We have addressed the feedback from the `a11y` audit and improved the IDP login screen
   accordingly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5376
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5377

* Bugfix - Forward basic auth to OpenID connect token authentication endpoint: [#2095](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2095)

   When using `PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true` we now forward request to the idp instead of
   trying to authenticate the request ourself.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2095
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2094

* Bugfix - Log all requests in the proxy access log: [#2301](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2301)

   We now use a dedicated middleware to log all requests, regardless of routing selector outcome.
   While the log now includes the remote address, the selected routing policy is only logged when
   log level is set to debug because the request context cannot be changed in the
   `directorSelectionDirector`, as per the `ReverseProxy.Director` documentation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2301

* Bugfix - Update glauth to 20210729125545-b9aecdfcac31: [#2336](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2336)

  * Fixes the backend config not being passed correctly in ocis

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v4.0.0: [#2353](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2353)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v4.0.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2353
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v4.0.0

* Enhancement - Proxy: Add claims policy selector: [#2248](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2248)

   Using the proxy config file, it is now possible to let let the IdP determine the routing policy by
   sending an `ocis.routing.policy` claim. Its value will be used to determine the set of routes
   for the logged in user.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2248

* Enhancement - Add ocs cache warmup config and warn on protobuf ns conflicts: [#2328](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2328)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2328

* Enhancement - Refactor graph API: [#2277](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2277)

   We refactored the `/graph/v1.0/` endpoint which now relies on the internal acces token fer
   authentication, getting rid of any LDAP or OIDC code to authenticate requests. This allows
   using the graph api when using basic auth or any other auth mechanism provided by the CS3 auth
   providers / reva gateway / ocis proxy.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2277

* Enhancement - Update REVA: [#2355](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2355)

   Update REVA from v1.10.1-0.20210730095301-fcb7a30a44a6 to

* Enhancement - Use only one go.mod file for project dependencies: [#2344](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2344)

   We now use one single go.mod file at the root of the repository rather than one per core
   extension.

* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.9.1: [#2280](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2280)

## Details

* Bugfix - Panic when service fails to start: [#2252](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2252)

   Tags: runtime

   When attempting to run a service through the runtime that is currently running and fails to
   start, a race condition still redirect os Interrupt signals to a closed channel.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2252

* Bugfix - Dont use port 80 as debug for GroupsProvider: [#2271](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2271)

   A copy/paste error where the configuration for the groupsprovider's debug address was not
   present leaves go-micro to start the debug service in port 80 by default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2271

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.4.0: [#2276](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2276)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v3.4.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2276
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.4.0

* Change - Update WEB to v3.4.1: [#2283](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2283)

  * Fix [5501](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5501): loading previews in the right sidebar
  * Fix [5493](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5493): view options position

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2283
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.4.1

* Enhancement - Runtime support for cherry picking extensions: [#2229](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2229)

   Support for running certain extensions supervised via cli flags. Example usage:

   ``` > ocis server --extensions="proxy, idp, storage-metadata, accounts" ```

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2229

* Enhancement - Add readonly mode for storagehome and storageusers: [#2230](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2230)

   To enable the readonly mode use `STORAGE_HOME_READ_ONLY=true` and
   `STORAGE_USERS_READ_ONLY=true`. Alternative: use `OCIS_STORAGE_READ_ONLY=true`

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2230

* Enhancement - Remove unnecessary Service.Init(): [#1705](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1705)

   As it turns out oCIS already calls this method. Invoking it twice would end in accidentally
   resetting values.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1705

* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.9.1-0.20210628143859-9d29c36c0c3f: [#2227](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2227)

# Changelog for [1.8.0] (2021-06-28)

The following sections list the changes for 1.8.0.

[1.8.0]: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0

## Summary

* Bugfix - External storage registration used wrong config: [#2120](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2120)
* Bugfix - Remove authentication from /status.php completely: [#2188](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2188)
* Bugfix - Make webdav namespace configurable across services: [#2198](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2198)
* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.3.0: [#2187](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2187)
* Enhancement - Properly configure graph-explorer client registration: [#2118](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2118)
* Enhancement - Use system default location to store TLS artefacts: [#2129](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2129)
* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.9: [#2205](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2205)

## Details

* Bugfix - External storage registration used wrong config: [#2120](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2120)

   The go-micro registry-singleton ignores the ocis configuration and defaults to mdns

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2120

* Bugfix - Remove authentication from /status.php completely: [#2188](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2188)

   Despite requests without Authentication header being successful, requests with an invalid
   bearer token in the Authentication header were rejected in the proxy with an 401
   unauthenticated. Now the Authentication header is completely ignored for the /status.php
   route.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8538
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2188

* Bugfix - Make webdav namespace configurable across services: [#2198](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2198)

   The WebDAV namespace is used across various services, but it was previously hardcoded in some
   of the services. This PR uses the same environment variable to set the config correctly across
   the services.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2198

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.3.0: [#2187](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2187)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v3.3.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2187
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.3.0

* Enhancement - Properly configure graph-explorer client registration: [#2118](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2118)

   The client registration in the `identifier-registration.yaml` for the graph-explorer
   didn't contain `redirect_uris` nor `origins`. Both were added to prevent exploitation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2118

* Enhancement - Use system default location to store TLS artefacts: [#2129](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2129)

   This used to default to the current location of the binary, which is not ideal after a first run as
   it leaves traces behind. It now uses the system's location for artefacts with the help of
   https://golang.org/pkg/os/#UserConfigDir.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2129

* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.9: [#2205](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2205)

   This update includes * [set Content-Type
   correctly](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1750) * [Return file checksum
   available from the metadata for the EOS
   driver](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1755) * [Sort share entries
   alphabetically](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1772) * [Initial work on the
   owncloudsql driver](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1710) * [Add user ID cache
   warmup to EOS storage driver](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1774) * [Use
   UidNumber and GidNumber fields in User
   objects](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1573) * [EOS GRPC
   interface](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1471) * [switch
   references](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1721) * [remove user's uuid from
   trashbin file key](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1793) * [fix restore behavior of
   the trashbin API](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1795) * [eosfs: add arbitrary
   metadata support](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1811)

## Details

* Bugfix - Change the groups index to be case sensitive: [#2109](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2109)

   Groups are considered to be case sensitive. The index must handle them case sensitive too
   otherwise we will have undeterministic behavior while editing or deleting groups.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2109

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.2.0: [#2096](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2096)

   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2096
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.2.0

* Enhancement - Enable the s3ng storage driver: [#1886](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1886)

   We have updated the color contrasts on the IDP pages in order to improve accessibility.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2088

* Enhancement - Announce user profile picture capability: [#2036](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2036)

   Added a new capability (through https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1694) to prevent the
   web frontend from fetching (nonexistent) user avatar profile pictures which added latency &
   console errors.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2036

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.7.1-0.20210531093513-b74a2b156af6: [#2104](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2104)

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.7.1-0.20210507160327-e2c3841d0dbc: [#2044](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2044)
* Enhancement - Use oc-select: [#1979](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1979)
* Enhancement - Set SameSite settings to Strict for Web: [#2019](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2019)

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix STORAGE_METADATA_ROOT default value override: [#1956](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1956)

   The way the value was being set ensured that it was NOT being overridden where it should have
   been. This patch ensures the correct loading order of values.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1956

* Bugfix - Stop the supervisor if a service fails to start: [#1963](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1963)

   Steps to make the supervisor fail:

   `PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9144 bin/ocis server`

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1963

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.1.0: [#2045](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2045)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v3.1.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2045
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.1.0

* Enhancement - Added dictionary files: [#2003](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2003)

   Added the dictionary.js file for package settings and accounts which contains strings that
   should be synced to transifex but not exist in the UI directly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2003

* Enhancement - Introduce login form with h1 tag for screen readers only: [#1991](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1991)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1991

* Enhancement - User Deprovisioning for the OCS API: [#1962](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1962)

   Use the CS3 API and Reva to deprovision users completely.

   Two new environment variables introduced: ``` OCS_IDM_ADDRESS OCS_STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER
   ```

   `OCS_IDM_ADDRESS` is also an alias for `OCIS_URL`; allows the OCS service to mint jwt tokens
   for the authenticated user that will be read by the reva authentication middleware.

   `OCS_STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER` determines how a user is deprovisioned. This kind of behavior is
   needed since every storage driver deals with deleting differently.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1962

* Enhancement - Support thumbnails for txt files: [#1988](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1988)

   Implemented support for thumbnails for txt files in the thumbnails service.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1988

  * Cache resources from share getter methods in OCS (https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1643)
  * Fix public file shares (https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1666)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2010

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.7.1-0.20210507160327-e2c3841d0dbc: [#2044](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2044)

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix thumbnail generation for jpegs: [#1785](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1785)

   Images with the extension `.jpeg` were not properly supported.

   We updated ownCloud Web to v2.1.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1811

* Enhancement - Add new build targets: [#1824](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1824)

   Make build target `build` used to build a binary twice, the second occurrence having symbols
   for debugging. We split this step in two and added `build-all` and `build-debug` targets.

   - `build-all` now behaves as the previous `build` target, it will generate 2 binaries, one for
   debug. - `build-debug` will build a single binary for debugging.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1824

* Enhancement - Clarify expected failures: [#1790](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1790)

   Some features, while covered by the ownCloud 10 acceptance tests, will not be implmented for
   now: - blacklisted / ignored files, because ocis does not need to blacklist `.htaccess` files -
   `OC-LazyOps` support was [removed from the
   clients](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8398). We are thinking about [a state
   machine for uploads to properly solve that scenario and also list the state of files in progress
   in the web ui](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/214). The expected failures
   files now have a dedicated _Won't fix_ section for these items.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/214
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1790
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8398

* Enhancement - Replace special character in login page title with a regular minus: [#1813](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1813)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1813

* Enhancement - File Logging: [#1816](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1816)

   When running supervised, support for configuring all logs to a single log file:
   `OCIS_LOG_FILE=/Users/foo/bar/ocis.log MICRO_REGISTRY=etcd bin/ocis server`

   Supports directing log from single extensions to a log file:
   `PROXY_LOG_FILE=/Users/foo/bar/proxy.log MICRO_REGISTRY=etcd bin/ocis proxy`

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1816

* Enhancement - Runtime Hostname and Port are now configurable: [#1822](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1822)

   Without any configuration the ocis runtime will start on `localhost:9250` unless specified
   otherwise. Usage:

   - `OCIS_RUNTIME_PORT=6061 bin/ocis server` - overrides the oCIS runtime and starts on port
   6061 - `OCIS_RUNTIME_PORT=6061 bin/ocis list` - lists running extensions for the runtime on
   `localhost:6061`

   All subcommands are updated and expected to work with the following environment variables:

   ``` OCIS_RUNTIME_HOST OCIS_RUNTIME_PORT ```

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1822

* Enhancement - Generate thumbnails for .gif files: [#1791](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1791)

   Added support for gifs to the thumbnails service.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1791

* Enhancement - Tracing Refactor: [#1819](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1819)

   Centralize tracing handling per extension.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1819

* Enhancement - Update go-micro to v3.5.1-0.20210217182006-0f0ace1a44a9: [#1670](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1670)
* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.6.1-0.20210223065028-53f39499762e: [#1683](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683)
* Enhancement - Add initial nats and kubernetes registry support: [#1697](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1697)

## Details

* Bugfix - Purposely delay accounts service startup: [#1734](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1734)

   As it turns out the race condition between `accounts <-> storage-metadata` still remains.
   This PR is a hotfix, and it should be followed up with a proper fix. Either:

   - block the accounts' initialization until the storage metadata is ready (using the registry)
   or - allow the accounts service to initialize and use a message broker to signal the accounts the
   metadata storage is ready to receive requests.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1734

* Bugfix - Add missing gateway config: [#1716](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1716)

   The auth provider `ldap` and `oidc` drivers now need to be able talk to the reva gateway. We added
   the `gatewayscv` to the config that is passed to reva.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1716

* Bugfix - Fix accounts initialization: [#1696](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1696)

   Originally the accounts service relies on both the `settings` and `storage-metadata` to be up
   and running at the moment it starts. This is an antipattern as it will cause the entire service to
   panic if the dependants are not present.

   We inverted this dependency and moved the default initialization data (i.e: creating roles,
   permissions, settings bundles) and instead of notifying the settings service that the
   account has to provide with such options, the settings is instead initialized with the options
   the accounts rely on. Essentially saving bandwith as there is no longer a gRPC call to the
   settings service.

   For the `storage-metadata` a retry mechanism was added that retries by default 20 times to
   fetch the `com.owncloud.storage.metadata` from the service registry every `500`
   miliseconds. If this retry expires the accounts panics, as its dependency on the
   `storage-metadata` service cannot be resolved.

   We also introduced a client wrapper that acts as middleware between a client and a server. For
   more information on how it works further read [here](https://github.com/sony/gobreaker)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1696

* Bugfix - Fix the ttl of the authentication middleware cache: [#1699](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1699)

   The authentication cache ttl was multiplied with `time.Second` multiple times. This
   resulted in a ttl that was not intended.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1699

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v2.0.1: [#1683](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v2.0.1. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v2.0.1

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v2.0.2: [#1776](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1776)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v2.0.2. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1776
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v2.0.2

* Enhancement - Remove the JWT from the log: [#1758](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1758)

   We were logging the JWT in some places. Secrets should not be exposed in logs so it got removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1758

* Enhancement - Update go-micro to v3.5.1-0.20210217182006-0f0ace1a44a9: [#1670](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1670)

   - We updated from go micro v2 (v2.9.1) go-micro v3 (v3.5.1 edge). - oCIS runtime is now aware of
   `MICRO_LOG_LEVEL` and is set to `error` by default. This decision was made because ownCloud,
   as framework builders, want to log everything oCIS related and hide everything unrelated by
   default. It can be re-enabled by setting it to a log level other than `error`. i.e:
   `MICRO_LOG_LEVEL=info`. - Updated `protoc-gen-micro` to the [latest
   version](https://github.com/asim/go-micro/tree/master/cmd/protoc-gen-micro). -
   We're using Prometheus wrappers from go-micro.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1670
   https://github.com/asim/go-micro/pull/2126

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.6.1-0.20210223065028-53f39499762e: [#1683](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683)

  * quota querying and tree accounting [cs3org/reva#1405](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1405)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1405

* Enhancement - Add initial nats and kubernetes registry support: [#1697](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1697)

   We added initial support to use nats and kubernetes as a service registry using
   `MICRO_REGISTRY=nats` and `MICRO_REGISTRY=kubernetes` respectively. Multiple nodes can
   be given with `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8,9.10.11.12`.

## Details

* Bugfix - Check if roles are present in user object before looking those up: [#1388](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1388)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1388

* Bugfix - Fix etcd address configuration: [#1546](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1546)

   The etcd server address in `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` was not picked up when etcd was set as
   service discovery registry `MICRO_REGISTRY=etcd`. Therefore etcd was only working if
   available on localhost / 127.0.0.1.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1546

* Bugfix - Remove unimplemented config file option for oCIS root command: [#1636](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1636)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1636

* Bugfix - Fix thumbnail generation when using different idp: [#1624](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1624)

   The thumbnail service was relying on a konnectd specific field in the access token. This logic
   was now replaced by a service parameter for the username.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1624
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1628

* Change - Initial release of graph and graph explorer: [#1594](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1594)

   Tags: graph, graph-explorer

   We brought initial basic Graph and Graph-Explorer support for the ownCloud Infinite Scale
   project.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1594
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-graph-explorer/pull/3

* Change - Move runtime code on refs/pman over to owncloud/ocis/ocis: [#1483](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1483)

   Tags: ocis, runtime

   Currently, the runtime is under the private account of an oCIS developer. For future-proofing
   we don't want oCIS mission critical components to depend on external repositories, so we're
   including refs/pman module as an oCIS package instead.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1483

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v2.0.0: [#1661](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1661)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v2.0.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1661
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v2.0.0

* Enhancement - Make use of new design-system oc-table: [#1597](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1597)

   Tags: ui, accounts

   The design-system table component has changed the way it's used. We updated accounts-ui to use
   the new 'oc-table-simple' component.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1597

* Enhancement - Use a default protocol parameter instead of explicitly disabling tus: [#1331](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1331)

   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1331
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1374

* Enhancement - Functionality to map home directory to different storage providers: [#1186](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1186)

   We added a parameter in reva that allows us to redirect /home requests to different storage
   providers based on a mapping derived from the user attributes, which was previously not
   possible since we hardcode the /home path for all users. For example, having its value as
   `/home/{{substr 0 1 .Username}}` can be used to redirect home requests for different users to
   different storage providers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1186
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1142

* Enhancement - Introduce ADR: [#1042](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1042)

   We will keep track of [Architectual Decision Records using

* Enhancement - Enable group sharing and add config for sharing SQL driver: [#1626](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1626)

   This PR adds config to support sharing with groups. It also introduces a breaking change for the
   CS3APIs definitions since grantees can now refer to both users as well as groups. Since we store
   the grantee information in a json file, `/var/tmp/ocis/storage/shares.json`, its previous
   version needs to be removed as we won't be able to unmarshal data corresponding to the previous
   definitions.

   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1191
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v1.0.1

* Enhancement - Add OCIS_URL env var: [#1148](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1148)

   Tags: ocis

   We introduced a new environment variable `OCIS_URL` that expects a URL including protocol,
   host and optionally port to simplify configuring all the different services. These existing
   environment variables still take precedence, but will also fall back to `OCIS_URL`:
   `STORAGE_LDAP_IDP`, `STORAGE_OIDC_ISSUER`, `PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER`,
   `STORAGE_FRONTEND_PUBLIC_URL`, `KONNECTD_ISS`, `WEB_OIDC_AUTHORITY`, and
   `WEB_UI_CONFIG_SERVER`.

   Some environment variables are now built dynamically if they are not set: -
   `STORAGE_DATAGATEWAY_PUBLIC_URL` defaults to `<STORAGE_FRONTEND_PUBLIC_URL>/data`,
   also falling back to `OCIS_URL` - `WEB_OIDC_METADATA_URL` defaults to
   `<WEB_OIDC_AUTHORITY>/.well-known/openid-configuration`, also falling back to
   `OCIS_URL`

   Furthermore, the built in konnectd will generate an `identifier-registration.yaml` that
   uses the `KONNECTD_ISS` in the allowed `redirect_uris` and `origins`. It simplifies the
   default `https://localhost:9200` and remote deployment with `OCIS_URL` which is evaluated
   as a fallback if `KONNECTD_ISS` is not set.

   An oCIS server can now be started on a remote machine as easy as
   `OCIS_URL=https://cloud.ocis.test PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:443 ocis server`.

   Note that the `OCIS_DOMAIN` environment variable is not used by oCIS, but by the docker
   containers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1148

* Enhancement - Use sync.cache for roles cache: [#1367](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1367)

   Tags: ocis-pkg

   Update ocis-pkg/roles cache to use ocis-pkg/sync cache

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1367

* Enhancement - Add named locks and refactor cache: [#1212](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1212)

   Tags: ocis-pkg, accounts

   We had the case that we needed kind of a named locking mechanism which enables us to lock only
   under certain conditions. It's used in the indexer package where we do not need to lock
   everything, instead just lock the requested parts and differentiate between reads and
   writes.

   This made it possible to entirely remove locks from the accounts service and move them to the
   ocis-pkg indexer. Another part of this refactor was to make the cache atomic and write tests for
   it.

   - remove locking from accounts service - add sync package with named mutex - add named locking to
   indexer - move cache to sync package

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/966
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1212

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.5.1: [#1372](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1372)

   Summary -------

  * Fix #1401: Use the user in request for deciding the layout for non-home DAV requests
  * Fix #1413: Re-include the '.git' dir in the Docker images to pass the version tag
  * Fix #1399: Fix ocis trash-bin purge
  * Enh #1397: Bump the Copyright date to 2021
  * Enh #1398: Support site authorization status in Mentix
  * Enh #1393: Allow setting favorites, mtime and a temporary etag
  * Enh #1403: Support remote cloud gathering metrics

   Details -------

  * Bugfix #1401: Use the user in request for deciding the layout for non-home DAV requests

   For the incoming /dav/files/userID requests, we have different namespaces depending on
   whether the request is for the logged-in user's namespace or not. Since in the storage drivers,
   we specify the layout depending only on the user whose resources are to be accessed, this fails
   when a user wants to access another user's namespace when the storage provider depends on the
   logged in user's namespace. This PR fixes that.

   For example, consider the following case. The owncloud fs uses a layout {{substr 0 1
   .Id.OpaqueId}}/{{.Id.OpaqueId}}. The user einstein sends a request to access a resource
   shared with him, say /dav/files/marie/abcd, which should be allowed. However, based on the
   way we applied the layout, there's no way in which this can be translated to /m/marie/.

  * Bugfix #1413: Re-include the '.git' dir in the Docker images to pass the version tag

   And git SHA to the release tool.

   Https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1413

  * Bugfix #1399: Fix ocis trash-bin purge

   Fixes the empty trash-bin functionality for ocis-storage

   Https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/254
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1399

  * Enhancement #1397: Bump the Copyright date to 2021

   Https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1397

  * Enhancement #1398: Support site authorization status in Mentix

   This enhancement adds support for a site authorization status to Mentix. This way, sites
   registered via a web app can now be excluded until authorized manually by an administrator.

   Furthermore, Mentix now sets the scheme for Prometheus targets. This allows us to also support
   monitoring of sites that do not support the default HTTPS scheme.

   Https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1398

  * Enhancement #1393: Allow setting favorites, mtime and a temporary etag

   We now let the oCIS driver persist favorites, set temporary etags and the mtime as arbitrary
   metadata.

   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/issues/1394
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1393

  * Enhancement #1403: Support remote cloud gathering metrics

   The current metrics package can only gather metrics either from json files. With this feature,
   the metrics can be gathered polling the http endpoints exposed by the owncloud/nextcloud
   sciencemesh apps.

   Https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1403

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1372

* Bugfix - Don't enforce empty external apps slice: [#473](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/473)

   Tags: web

   The command for ocis-phoenix enforced an empty external apps configuration. This was
   removed, as it was blocking a new set of default external apps in ocis-phoenix.

* Bugfix - Make settings service start without go coroutines: [#835](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/835)

   The go routines cause a race condition that sometimes causes the tests to fail. The ListRoles
   request would not return all permissions.

* Bugfix - Fix button layout after phoenix update: [#625](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/625)

   Tags: accounts

   With the phoenix update to v0.17.0 a new ODS version was released which has a breaking change for
   buttons regarding their layouting. We adjusted the button layout in the accounts UI
   accordingly.

* Bugfix - Use micro default client: [#718](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/718)

   Tags: glauth

   We found a file descriptor leak in the glauth connections to the accounts service. Fixed it by
   using the micro default client.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/718

* Bugfix - Allow consent-prompt with switch-account: [#788](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/788)

   Multiple prompt values are allowed and this change fixes the check for select_account if it was
   used together with other prompt values. Where select_account previously was ignored, it is
   now processed as required, fixing the use case when a RP wants to trigger select_account first
   while at the same time wants also to request interactive consent.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/788

* Bugfix - Mint token with uid and gid: [#737](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/737)

   Tags: accounts

   The eos driver expects the uid and gid from the opaque map of a user. While the proxy does mint
   tokens correctly, the accounts service wasn't.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/737

* Bugfix - Serve index.html for directories: [#912](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/912)

   The static middleware in ocis-pkg now serves index.html instead of returning 404 on paths with
   a trailing `/`.

* Bugfix - Permission checks for settings write access: [#1092](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1092)

   Tags: settings

   There were several endpoints with write access to the settings service that were not protected
   by permission checks. We introduced a generic settings management permission to fix this for
   now. Will be more fine grained later on.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1092

* Bugfix - Fix minor ui bugs: [#1043](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1043)

   - the ui haven't updated the language of the items in the settings view menu. Now we listen to the
   selected language and update the ui - deduplicate resetMenuItems call

* Bugfix - Disable public link expiration by default: [#987](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/987)

   Tags: storage

   The public link expiration was enabled by default and didn't have a default expiration span by
   default, which resulted in already expired public links coming from the public link quick
   action. We fixed this by disabling the public link expiration by default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/987
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1035

* Bugfix - Build docker images with alpine:latest instead of alpine:edge: [#416](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/416)

   Tags: docker

   ARM builds were failing when built on alpine:edge, so we switched to alpine:latest instead.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/416

* Change - Accounts UI shows message when no permissions: [#656](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/656)

   We improved the UX of the accounts UI by showing a message information the user about missing
   permissions when the accounts or roles fail to load. This was showing an indeterminate
   progress bar before.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/656

* Change - Cache password validation: [#958](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/958)

   Tags: accounts

   The password validity check for requests like `login eq '%s' and password eq '%s'` is now cached
   for 10 minutes. This improves the performance for basic auth requests.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/958

* Change - Filesystem based index: [#709](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/709)

   Tags: accounts, storage

   We replaced `bleve` with a new filesystem based index implementation. There is an `indexer`
   which is capable of orchestrating different index types to build indices on documents by
   field. You can choose from the index types `unique`, `non-unique` or `autoincrement`.
   Indices can be utilized to run search queries (full matches or globbing) on document fields.
   The accounts service is using this index internally to run the search queries coming in via
   `ListAccounts` and `ListGroups` and to generate UIDs for new accounts as well as GIDs for new
   groups.

   The accounts service can be configured to store the index on the local FS / a NFS (`disk`
   implementation of the index) or to use an arbitrary storage ( `cs3` implementation of the
   index). `cs3` is the new default, which is configured to use the `metadata` storage.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/709

* Change - Rebuild index command for accounts: [#748](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/748)

   Tags: accounts

   The index for the accounts service can now be rebuilt by running the cli command `./bin/ocis
   accounts rebuild`. It deletes all configured indices and rebuilds them from the documents
   found on storage. For this we also introduced a `LoadAccounts` and `LoadGroups` function on
   storage for loading all existing documents.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/748

* Change - Add the thumbnails command: [#156](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/156)

   Tags: thumbnails

   Added the thumbnails command so that the thumbnails service can get started via ocis.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/156

* Change - CS3 can be used as accounts-backend: [#1020](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1020)

   Tags: proxy

   PROXY_ACCOUNT_BACKEND_TYPE=cs3 PROXY_ACCOUNT_BACKEND_TYPE=accounts (default)

   By using a backend which implements the CS3 user-api (currently provided by reva/storage) it
   is possible to bypass the ocis-accounts service and for example use ldap directly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1020

* Change - Use bcrypt to hash the user passwords: [#510](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/510)

   Change the hashing algorithm from SHA-512 to bcrypt since the latter is better suitable for
   password hashing. This is a breaking change. Existing deployments need to regenerate the
   accounts folder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/510

* Change - Replace the library which scales the images: [#910](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/910)

   The library went out of support. Also did some refactoring of the thumbnails service code.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/910

* Change - Choose disk or cs3 storage for accounts and groups: [#623](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/623)

   Tags: accounts

   The accounts service now has an abstraction layer for the storage. In addition to the local disk
   implementation we implemented a cs3 storage, which is the new default for the accounts
   service.

* Change - Improve reva service descriptions: [#536](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/536)

   Tags: docs

   The descriptions make it clearer that the services actually represent a mount point in the
   combined storage. Each mount point can have a different driver.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/536

* Change - Initial release of basic version: [#2](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2)

   Just prepared an initial basic version which simply embeds the minimum of required services in
   the context of the ownCloud Infinite Scale project.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2

   user-account information.

   Tags: konnectd

   After bringing our theme into konnectd, we've had to adjust the styles of the consent page so the
   text is visible and button reflects our theme.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/754

* Change - Make all paths configurable and default to a common temp dir: [#1080](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1080)

   Aligned all services to use a dir following`/var/tmp/ocis/<service>/...` by default. Also
   made some missing temp paths configurable via env vars and config flags.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1080

* Change - Move the indexer package from ocis/accounts to ocis/ocis-pkg: [#794](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/794)

   We are making that change for semantic reasons. So consumers of any index don't necessarily
   need to know of the accounts service.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/794

* Change - Switch over to a new custom-built runtime: [#287](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/287)

   We moved away from using the go-micro runtime and are now using [our own
   runtime](https://github.com/refs/pman). This allows us to spawn service processes even
   when they are using different versions of go-micro. On top of that we now have the commands `ocis
   list`, `ocis kill` and `ocis run` available for service runtime management.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/287

* Change - Move ocis default config to root level: [#842](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/842)

   Tags: ocis

   We moved the tracing config to the `root` flagset so that they are parsed on all commands. We also
   introduced a `JWTSecret` flag in the root flagset, in order to apply a common default JWTSecret
   to all services that have one.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/842
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/843

* Change - Remove username field in OCS: [#709](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/709)

   Tags: ocs

   We use the incoming userid as both the `id` and the `on_premises_sam_account_name` for new
   accounts in the accounts service. The userid in OCS requests is in fact the username, not our
   internal account id. We need to enforce the userid as our internal account id though, because
   the account id is part of various `path` formats.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/709
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/816

* Change - Account management permissions for Admin role: [#124](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/124)

   Tags: accounts, settings

   We created an `AccountManagement` permission and added it to the default admin role. There are
   permission checks in place to protected http endpoints in ocis-accounts against requests
   without the permission. All existing default users (einstein, marie, richard) have the
   default user role now (doesn't have the `AccountManagement` permission). Additionally,
   there is a new default Admin user with credentials `moss:vista`.

   Known issue: for users without the `AccountManagement` permission, the accounts UI
   extension is still available in the ocis-web app switcher, but the requests for loading the
   users will fail (as expected). We are working on a way to hide the accounts UI extension if the
   user doesn't have the `AccountManagement` permission.

   Tags: proxy

   We can now configure the proxy if insecure upstream servers are allowed. This was added since
   you need to disable certificate checks fore some situations like testing.

* Change - Make ocis-settings available: [#287](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/287)

* Change - Unify Configuration Parsing: [#675](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/675)

   Tags: ocis

   - responsibility for config parsing should be on the subcommand - if there is a config file in the
   environment location, env var should take precedence - general rule of thumb: the more
   explicit the config file is that would be picked up. Order from less to more explicit: - config
   location (/etc/ocis) - environment variable - cli flag

* Change - Update reva to v1.4.1-0.20201209113234-e791b5599a89: [#1089](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1089)

   Updated reva to v1.4.1-0.20201209113234-e791b5599a89

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1089

* Change - Clarify storage driver env vars: [#729](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/729)

   After renaming ocsi-reva to storage and combining the storage and data providers some env vars
   were confusingly named `STORAGE_STORAGE_...`. We are changing the prefix for driver related
   env vars to `STORAGE_DRIVER_...`. This makes changing the storage driver using eg.:
   `STORAGE_HOME_DRIVER=eos` and setting driver options using
   `STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_LAYOUT=...` less confusing.

  * Bugfix - Update LDAP filters: [#399](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/399)

   With the separation of use and find filters we can now use a filter that taken into account a users
   uuid as well as his username. This is necessary to make sharing work with the new account service
   which assigns accounts an immutable account id that is different from the username.
   Furthermore, the separate find filters now allows searching users by their displayname or
   email as well.

   ``` userfilter =
   "(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(|(ownclouduuid={{.OpaqueId}})(cn={{.OpaqueId}})))"
   findfilter =
   "(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(|(cn={{query}}*)(displayname={{query}}*)(mail={{query}}*)))"
   ```

  * Change - Environment updates for the username userid split: [#420](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/420)

   We updated the owncloud storage driver in reva to properly look up users by userid or username
   using the userprovider instead of taking the path segment as is. This requires the user service
   address as well as changing the default layout to the userid instead of the username. The latter
   is not considered a stable and persistent identifier.

  * Bugfix - Stop advertising unsupported chunking v2: [#145](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/145)

   Removed "chunking" attribute in the DAV capabilities. Please note that chunking v2 is
   advertised as "chunking 1.0" while chunking v1 is the attribute "bigfilechunking" which is
   already false.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/145

  * Enhancement - Allow configuring the gateway for dataproviders: [#136](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/136)

   This allows using basic or bearer auth when directly talking to dataproviders.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/136

  * Enhancement - Use a configured logger on reva runtime: [#153](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/153)

   For consistency reasons we need a configured logger that is inline with an ocis logger, so the
   log cascade can be easily parsed by a human.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/153

  * Bugfix - Fix eos user sharing config: [#127](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/127)

   We have added missing config options for the user sharing manager and added a dedicated eos
   storage command with pre configured settings for the eos-docker container. It configures a
   `Shares` folder in a users home when using eos as the storage driver.

  * Bugfix - Fix eos config: [#125](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/125)

   We have added missing config options for the home layout to the config struct that is passed to
   eos.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/125

  * Bugfix - Set correct flag type in the flagsets: [#75](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/75)

   While upgrading to the micro/cli version 2 there where two instances of `StringFlag` which had
   not been changed to `StringSliceFlag`. This caused `ocis-reva users` and `ocis-reva
   storage-root` to fail on startup.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/76

  * Bugfix - We fixed a typo in the `REVA_LDAP_SCHEMA_MAIL` environment variable: [#113](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/113)

   It was misspelled as `REVA_LDAP_SCHEMA_Mail`.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/113

  * Bugfix - Allow different namespaces for /webdav and /dav/files: [#68](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/68)

   After fbf131c the path for the "new" webdav path does not contain a username
   `/remote.php/dav/files/textfile0.txt`. It used to be
   `/remote.php/dav/files/oc/einstein/textfile0.txt` So it lost `oc/einstein`.

   This PR allows setting up different namespaces for `/webav` and `/dav/files`:

   `/webdav` is jailed into `/home` - which uses the home storage driver and uses the logged in user
   to construct the path `/dav/files` is jailed into `/oc` - which uses the owncloud storage
   driver and expects a username as the first path segment

   This mimics oc10

   The `WEBDAV_NAMESPACE_JAIL` environment variable is split into - `WEBDAV_NAMESPACE` and -
   `DAV_FILES_NAMESPACE` accordingly.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/68 related:

  * Change - Use /home as default namespace: [#68](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/68)

   Currently, cross storage etag propagation is not yet implemented, which prevents the desktop
   client from detecting changes via the PROPFIND to /. / is managed by the root storage provider
   which is independend of the home and oc storage providers. If a file changes in /home/foo, the
   etag change will only be propagated to the root of the home storage provider.

   This change jails users into the `/home` namespace, and allows configuring the namespace to
   use for the two webdav endpoints using the new environment variable `WEBDAV_NAMESPACE_JAIL`
   which affects both endpoints `/dav/files` and `/webdav`.

   This will allow us to focus on getting a single storage driver like eos or owncloud tested and
   better resembles what owncloud 10 does.

   To get back the global namespace, which ultimately is the goal, just set the above environment
   variable to `/`.

  * Change - Initial release of basic version: [#1](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/1)

   Just prepared an initial basic version to start a reva server and start integrating with the
   go-micro base dextension framework of ownCloud Infinite Scale.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/1

  * Change - Start multiple services with dedicated commands: [#6](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/6)

   The initial version would only allow us to use a set of reva configurations to start multiple
   services. We use a more opinionated set of commands to start dedicated services that allows us
   to configure them individually. It allows us to switch eg. the user backend to LDAP and fully use
   it on the cli.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/6

  * Change - Storage providers now default to exposing data servers: [#89](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/89)

   The flags that let reva storage providers announce that they expose a data server now defaults
   to true:

   `REVA_STORAGE_HOME_EXPOSE_DATA_SERVER=1` `REVA_STORAGE_OC_EXPOSE_DATA_SERVER=1`

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/89

  * Change - Default to running behind ocis-proxy: [#113](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/113)

   We changed the default configuration to integrate better with ocis.

   - We use ocis-glauth as the default ldap server on port 9125 with base `dc=example,dc=org`. - We
   use a dedicated technical `reva` user to make ldap binds - Clients are supposed to use the
   ocis-proxy endpoint `https://localhost:9200` - We removed unneeded ocis configuration
   from the frontend which no longer serves an oidc provider. - We changed the default user
   OpaqueID attribute from `sub` to `preferred_username`. The latter is a claim populated by
   konnectd that can also be used by the reva ldap user manager to look up users by their OpaqueId

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/113

  * Enhancement - Expose owncloud storage driver config in flagset: [#87](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/87)

   `REVA_STORAGE_OWNCLOUD_SCAN` cli option: `--storage-owncloud-scan`

   - autocreate home path for new users default: `true` env var:
   `REVA_STORAGE_OWNCLOUD_AUTOCREATE` cli option: `--storage-owncloud-autocreate`

   - the address of the redis server default: `:6379` env var:
   `REVA_STORAGE_OWNCLOUD_REDIS_ADDR` cli option: `--storage-owncloud-redis`

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/87

  * Enhancement - Update reva to v0.0.2-0.20200212114015-0dbce24f7e8b: [#91](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/91)

   Reva has seen a lot of changes that allow us to - reduce the configuration overhead - use the
   autocreato home folder option - use the home folder path layout option - no longer start the root
   storage

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/91 related:

  * Enhancement - Allow configuring user sharing driver: [#115](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/115)

   We now default to `json` which persists shares in the sharing manager in a json file instead of an
   in memory db.

* Enhancement - Better adopt Go-Micro: [#840](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/840)

   Tags: ocis

   There are a few building blocks that we were relying on default behavior, such as
   `micro.Registry` and the go-micro client. In order for oCIS to work in any environment and not
   relying in black magic configuration or running daemons we need to be able to:

   - Provide with a configurable go-micro registry. - Use our own go-micro client adjusted to our
   own needs (i.e: custom timeout, custom dial timeout, custom transport...)

   This PR is relying on 2 env variables from Micro: `MICRO_REGISTRY` and
   `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`. The latter does not make sense to provide if the registry is not
   `etcd`.

   The current implementation only accounts for `mdns` and `etcd` registries, defaulting to
   `mdns` when not explicitly defined to use `etcd`.

* Enhancement - Add permission check when assigning and removing roles: [#879](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/879)

   Everyone could add and remove roles from users. Added a new permission and a check so that only
   users with the role management permissions can assign and unassign roles.

* Enhancement - Create OnlyOffice extension: [#857](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/857)

   Tags: OnlyOffice

   We've created an OnlyOffice extension which enables users to create and edit docx documents
   and open spreadsheets and presentations.

* Enhancement - Show basic-auth warning only once: [#886](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/886)

   Show basic-auth warning only on startup instead on every request.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/886

* Enhancement - Add glauth fallback backend: [#649](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/649)

   We introduced the `fallback-datastore` config option and the corresponding options to allow
   configuring a simple chain of two handlers.

   Simple, because it is intended for bind and single result search queries. Merging large sets of
   results is currently out of scope. For now, the implementation will only search the fallback
   backend if the default backend returns an error or the number of results is 0. This is sufficient
   to allow an IdP to authenticate users from ocis as well as owncloud 10 as described in the [bridge
   scenario](https://owncloud.github.io/ocis/deployment/bridge/).

* Enhancement - Tidy dependencies: [#845](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/845)

   Methodology:

   ``` go-modules() { find . \( -name vendor -o -name '[._].*' -o -name node_modules \) -prune -o
   -name go.mod -print | sed 's:/go.mod$::' } ```

   ``` for m in $(go-modules); do (cd $m && go mod tidy); done ```

* Enhancement - Launch a storage to store ocis-metadata: [#602](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/602)

   Tags: metadata, accounts, settings

   In the future accounts, settings etc. should be stored in a dedicated metadata storage. The
   services should talk to this storage directly, bypassing reva-gateway.

* Enhancement - Add a version command to ocis: [#915](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/915)

   The version command was only implemented in the extensions. This adds the version command to
   ocis to list all services in the ocis namespace.

* Enhancement - Cache userinfo in proxy: [#877](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/877)

   Tags: proxy

   We introduced caching for the userinfo response. The token expiration is used for cache
   invalidation if available. Otherwise we fall back to a preconfigured TTL (default 10
   seconds).

* Enhancement - Update OCIS Runtime: [#1108](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1108)

   - enhances the overall behavior of our runtime - runtime `db` file configurable - two new env
   variables to deal with the runtime - `RUNTIME_DB_FILE` and `RUNTIME_KEEP_ALIVE` -
   `RUNTIME_KEEP_ALIVE` defaults to `false` to provide backwards compatibility - if
   `RUNTIME_KEEP_ALIVE` is set to `true`, if a supervised process terminates the runtime will
   attempt to start with the same environment provided.

* Enhancement - Add www-authenticate based on user agent: [#1009](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1009)

   Tags: reva, proxy

   We now comply with HTTP spec by adding Www-Authenticate headers on every `401` request.
   Furthermore, we not only take care of such a thing at the Proxy but also Reva will take care of it.
   In addition, we now are able to lock-in a set of User-Agent to specific challenges.

   Admins can use this feature by configuring oCIS + Reva following this approach:

   ``` STORAGE_FRONTEND_MIDDLEWARE_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_BY_USER_AGENT="mirall:basic,
   Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:83.0) Gecko/20100101
   Firefox/83.0:bearer" \
   PROXY_MIDDLEWARE_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_BY_USER_AGENT="mirall:basic, Mozilla/5.0
   (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:83.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/83.0:bearer" \
   PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true \ go run cmd/ocis/main.go server ```

   We introduced two new environment variables:

   `STORAGE_FRONTEND_MIDDLEWARE_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_BY_USER_AGENT` as well as
   `PROXY_MIDDLEWARE_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_BY_USER_AGENT`, The reason they have the same value
   is not to rely on the os env on a distributed environment, so in redundancy we trust. They both
   configure the same on the backend storage and oCIS Proxy.
