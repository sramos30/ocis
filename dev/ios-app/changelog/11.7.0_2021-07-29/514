Change: Clipboard Support

Clipboard support provides the following new features:
- Copy: Files can be copied to the system-wide clipboard and pasted into other apps. Folders can also be copied within the ownCloud app.
- Paste: Files can be pasted from the system-wide clipboard into the ownCloud app. Likewise, files and folders copied within the app can be pasted. 
- Cut: Within an ownCloud account, files and folders can be cut and pasted to a different path. After this action, the items are no longer present in the original location.
