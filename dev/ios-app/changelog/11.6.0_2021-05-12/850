Change: Enhanced drag & drop support

Fix drag and drop and improve support to run the iOS app on M1 Macs:

- add drag-out support for files that are not locally available yet
- improve drag-in support for files, picking the best available representation that can be retrieved as data
- support for drag & drop in the log file browser
