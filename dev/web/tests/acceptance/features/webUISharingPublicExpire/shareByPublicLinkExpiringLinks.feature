Feature: Share by public link
  As a user
  I want to be able to set an expiry date on my public links
  So that I don't have to remember to unshare

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server


  Scenario: user changes the expiration date of an already existing public link using webUI
    Given user "Alice" has created file "lorem.txt" in the server
    And user "Alice" has created a public link with following settings in the server
      | path       | lorem.txt   |
      | name       | Public link |
      | expireDate | 2038-10-14  |
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user edits the public link named "Public link" of file "lorem.txt" changing following
      | expireDate | 2038 July 21 |
    Then the last public link share response of user "Alice" should include the following fields in the server
      | expireDate | 2038-07-21 |

  Scenario Outline: auto set expiration date on public link (with default amount of expiry days)
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date" of app "core" has been set to "yes" in the server
    And user "Alice" has created <element> "<shared-resource>" in the server
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user creates a new public link for resource "<shared-resource>" using the webUI
    Then user "Alice" should have a share with these details in the server:
      | field       | value              |
      | share_type  | public_link        |
      | uid_owner   | Alice              |
      | permissions | read               |
      | path        | /<shared-resource> |
      | name        | Public link        |
      | expiration  | +7                 |
    Examples:
      | element | shared-resource |
      | file    | lorem.txt       |
      | folder  | simple-folder   |

  Scenario Outline: auto set expiration date on public link (with set amount expiry days)
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date" of app "core" has been set to "yes" in the server
    And the setting "shareapi_expire_after_n_days" of app "core" has been set to "42" in the server
    And user "Alice" has created <element> "<shared-resource>" in the server
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user creates a new public link for resource "<shared-resource>" using the webUI
    Then user "Alice" should have a share with these details in the server:
      | field       | value              |
      | share_type  | public_link        |
      | uid_owner   | Alice              |
      | permissions | read               |
      | path        | /<shared-resource> |
      | name        | Public link        |
      | expiration  | +42                |
    Examples:
      | element | shared-resource |
      | file    | lorem.txt       |
      | folder  | simple-folder   |

  @issue-ocis-1328
  Scenario: expiry date is set to enforced max expiry date when creating a public link to a date that is past the enforced max expiry date
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date" of app "core" has been set to "yes" in the server
    And the setting "shareapi_expire_after_n_days" of app "core" has been set to "7" in the server
    And the setting "shareapi_enforce_expire_date" of app "core" has been set to "yes" in the server
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder" in the server
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user tries to create a new public link for resource "simple-folder" which expires in "+15" days using the webUI
    Then the link expiration date shown on the webUI should be "+7" days
    And user "Alice" should not have created any shares in the server

  @issue-ocis-1328
  Scenario: user cannot change the expiry date of an existing public link to a date that is past the enforced max expiry date
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date" of app "core" has been set to "yes" in the server
    And the setting "shareapi_enforce_expire_date" of app "core" has been set to "yes" in the server
    And user "Alice" has created file "lorem.txt" in the server

      | path       | lorem.txt   |
      | name       | Public link |
      | expireDate | +6          |
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user tries to edit expiration of the public link named "Public link" of file "lorem.txt" to past date "+15 days"
    Then user "Alice" should have a share with these details in the server:
      | field       | value       |
      | share_type  | public_link |
      | uid_owner   | Alice       |
      | permissions | read        |
      | path        | /lorem.txt  |
      | name        | Public link |
      | expiration  | +6          |

  @issue-ocis-1328
  Scenario: user cannot change the expiry date on existing public link to a date past the enforced max expiry date once max expiry date is changed

    And user "Alice" has created file "lorem.txt" in the server
    And user "Alice" has created a public link with following settings in the server
      | path       | lorem.txt   |
      | name       | Public link |
      | expireDate | +16         |
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And the setting "shareapi_expire_after_n_days" of app "core" has been set to "7" in the server
    When the user edits the public link named "Public link" of file "lorem.txt" changing following
      | expireDate | +15 |
    Then the user should see an error message on the public link share dialog saying "Cannot set expiration date more than 7 days in the future"
    And user "Alice" should have a share with these details in the server:
      | field       | value       |
      | share_type  | public_link |
      | uid_owner   | Alice       |
      | permissions | read        |

      | name        | Public link |
      | expiration  | +16         |
