Feature: accept/decline shares coming from internal users
  As a user
  I want to have control of which received shares I accept
  So that I can keep my file system clean

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no" in the server
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares" in the server
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI

  Scenario: reject a share that you received as user and as group member
    Given these groups have been created in the server:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/simple-folder" in the server
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1" in the server
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/simple-folder" with user "Brian" in the server
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/simple-folder" with group "grp1" in the server
    And the user has browsed to the shared-with-me page
    When the user declines share "simple-folder" offered by user "Alice Hansen" using the webUI
    And the user browses to the shared-with-me page in declined shares view
    Then folder "simple-folder" shared by "Alice Hansen" should be in "Declined" state on the webUI
    When the user browses to the files page
    Then folder "/Shares" should not be listed on the webUI
