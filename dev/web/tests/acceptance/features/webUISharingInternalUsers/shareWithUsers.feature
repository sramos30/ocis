Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal users
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with other users
  So that those users can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no" in the server
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares" in the server
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder" in the server

  Scenario Outline: share a file & folder with another internal user
    Given user "Brian" has created file "testimage.jpg" in the server
    And user "Brian" has created file "simple-folder/lorem.txt" in the server
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice Hansen" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    And user "Alice" accepts the share "Shares/simple-folder" offered by user "Brian" using the sharing API in the server
    And the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with user "Alice Hansen" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    And user "Alice" accepts the share "Shares/testimage.jpg" offered by user "Brian" using the sharing API in the server
    Then user "Alice Hansen" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "Alice Hansen" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for file "testimage.jpg" on the webUI
    And user "Alice" should have received a share with these details in the server:
      | field       | value                 |
      | uid_owner   | Brian                 |
      | share_with  | Alice                 |
      | file_target | /Shares/simple-folder |
      | item_type   | folder                |
      | permissions | <permissions-folder>  |
    And user "Alice" should have received a share with these details in the server:
      | field       | value                 |
      | uid_owner   | Brian                 |
      | share_with  | Alice                 |
      | file_target | /Shares/testimage.jpg |
      | item_type   | file                  |
      | permissions | <permissions-file>    |
    When the user re-logs in as "Alice" using the webUI
    And the user opens folder "Shares" using the webUI
    Then these files should be listed on the webUI
      | files         |
      | simple-folder |
      | testimage.jpg |
    # When the user opens the share dialog for file "simple-folder" using the webUI
    # Then user "Brian Murphy" should be listed as "Owner" in the collaborators list on the webUI
    # When the user opens the share dialog for file "testimage.jpg" using the webUI
    # Then user "Brian Murphy" should be listed as "Owner" in the collaborators list on the webUI
    Examples:
      | set-role           | expected-role      | permissions-folder              | permissions-file  |
      | Viewer             | Viewer             | read,share                      | read, share       |
      | Editor             | Editor             | read,update,create,delete,share | read,update,share |
      | Custom permissions | Custom permissions | read                            | read              |
