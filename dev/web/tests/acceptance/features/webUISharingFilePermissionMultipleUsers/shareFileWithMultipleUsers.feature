Feature: Sharing files with multiple internal users with different permissions
  As a user
  I want to set different permissions on shared files with other users
  So that I can control the access on those files by other collaborators

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no" in the server
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares" in the server
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |

  Scenario Outline: share a file with multiple users with different roles and permissions
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server:
      | username |
      | user0    |
      | Carol    |
      | David    |
    And user "Alice" has created file "lorem.txt" in the server
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user opens the share dialog for file "lorem.txt" using the webUI

    And the user selects the following collaborators for the share as "<role>" with "<extra-permissions>" permissions:
      | collaborator | type |
      | Regular User | user |
      | Brian Murphy | user |
      | Carol King   | user |
      | David Lopez  | user |
    And the user removes "David Lopez" as a collaborator from the share
    And the user removes "Regular User" as a collaborator from the share
    Then user "David Lopez" should not be visible in the collaborators selected options in the webUI
    And user "Regular User" should not be visible in the collaborators selected options in the webUI
    When the user shares with the selected collaborators
    And user "Brian" accepts the share "Shares/lorem.txt" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API in the server
    And user "Carol" accepts the share "Shares/lorem.txt" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API in the server
    Then custom permissions "<displayed-permissions>" should be set for user "Brian Murphy" for file "lorem.txt" on the webUI
    And custom permissions "<displayed-permissions>" should be set for user "Carol King" for file "lorem.txt" on the webUI
    And user "Brian Murphy" should be listed as "<displayed-role>" in the collaborators list for file "lorem.txt" on the webUI
    And user "Carol King" should be listed as "<displayed-role>" in the collaborators list for file "lorem.txt" on the webUI
    And user "Brian" should have received a share with these details in the server:
      | field       | value                |
      | uid_owner   | Alice                |
      | share_with  | Brian                |
      | file_target | /Shares/lorem.txt    |
      | item_type   | file                 |
      | permissions | <actual-permissions> |
    And user "Carol" should have received a share with these details in the server:
      | field       | value                |
      | uid_owner   | Alice                |
      | share_with  | Carol                |
      | file_target | /Shares/lorem.txt    |
      | item_type   | file                 |
      | permissions | <actual-permissions> |
    But user "Regular User" should not be listed in the collaborators list on the webUI
    And as "user0" file "/Shares/lorem.txt" should not exist in the server
    And user "David Lopez" should not be listed in the collaborators list on the webUI
    And as "David" file "/Shares/lorem.txt" should not exist in the server
    Examples:
      | role                 | displayed-role       | extra-permissions | displayed-permissions | actual-permissions  |
      | Viewer               | Viewer               | ,                 | ,                     | read, share         |
      | Editor               | Editor               | ,                 | ,                     | read, update, share |
      | Custom permissions   | Custom permissions   | ,                 | ,                     | read                |
      | Custom permissions   | Viewer               | share             | ,                     | read, share         |
      | Custom permissions   | Custom permissions   | update            | update                | read, update        |
      | Custom permissions   | Editor               | share, update     | ,                     | read, update, share |
