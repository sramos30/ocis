Feature: Upload into a folder Shares
  This suite of tests describes different behavior in oCIS and os ownCloud10 with respect to
  the folder "Shares".
  The folder "Shares" in oCIS is the mount point for all incoming shares so it is only used for reading
  The folder "Shares" in ownCloud10 is a folder in which you can download or save files

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no" in the server
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares" in the server
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server

  @issue-ocis-2322 @notToImplementOnOCIS
  Scenario: the Shares folder does not exist if no share has been accepted
    Given user "Brian" has created file "lorem.txt" in the server
    And user "Brian" has shared file "lorem.txt" with user "Alice" with "all" permissions in the server
    When user "Alice" logs in using the webUI
    Then folder "Shares" should not be listed on the webUI

  @issue-ocis-2322 @notToImplementOnOC10
  Scenario: the Shares folder should not be listed even without any share
    When user "Alice" logs in using the webUI
    Then folder "Shares" should not be listed on the webUI


  Scenario: the Shares folder exists after accepting the first shared file
    Given user "Brian" has created file "lorem.txt" in the server
    And user "Brian" has shared file "lorem.txt" with user "Alice" with "all" permissions in the server
    And user "Alice" has accepted the share "Shares/lorem.txt" offered by user "Brian" in the server
    When user "Alice" logs in using the webUI
    Then folder "Shares" should be listed on the webUI
