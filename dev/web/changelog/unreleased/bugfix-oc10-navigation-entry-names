Bugfix: Use oC10 navigation entry names

When fetching navigation entries from oC10, we previously used the app's names. This caused issues when the navigation entry ID and the app ID differ. Also, the navigation entries did not match with the ones in the classic UI.
This has been fixed as we now use the navigation entry name, which falls back to the app name if not given.
