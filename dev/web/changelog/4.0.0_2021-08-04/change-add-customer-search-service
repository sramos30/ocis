Change: Add custom search service

We've added `search` as another core app that can be utilized by 
other (third-party) frontend extensions to provide 
filter and search functionality.
Please note that you need to add `search` to the `apps` array of your config.json file, otherwise the search bar with its global file search capabilities will disappear.
