Bugfix: Clean router path handling

This patch was already introduced earlier for the files application only.
In the meantime we found out that this is also needed on different places across the ecosystem.

We've refactored the way how the patch gets applied to the routes: It is now possible to set an individual route's `meta.patchCleanPath` to true.
