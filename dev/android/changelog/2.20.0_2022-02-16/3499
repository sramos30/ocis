Enhancement: "Open with" action now allows editing

Previously, when a document file was opened and edited with an external
app, changes weren't saved because it didn't synchronized with the server.
Now, when you edit a document and navigate or refresh in the ownCloud app,
it synchronizes automatically, keeping consistence of your files.
