Feature: remove account connection

  As a user
  I want to remove my account
  So that I won't be using any client-UI services


  Scenario: remove an account connection
    Given user "Alice" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Brian" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
    And the user has added another account with
      | server   | %local_server% |
      | user     | Brian          |
      | password | AaBb2Cc3Dd4    |
    When the user removes the connection for user "Brian" and host %local_server_hostname%
    Then an account should be displayed with the displayname Alice Hansen and host %local_server_hostname%


  Scenario: remove the only account connection
    Given user "Alice" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
    When the user removes the connection for user "Alice" and host %local_server_hostname%
    Then connection wizard should be visible
