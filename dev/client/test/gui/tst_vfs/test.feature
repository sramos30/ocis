Feature: Enable/disable virtual file support

    As a user
    I want to enable virtual file support
    So that I can synchronize virtual files with local folder


    Scenario: Enable VFS
        Given user "Alice" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
        When the user enables virtual file support
        Then the "Disable virtual file support..." button should be available
        And VFS enabled baseline image should match the default screenshot


    Scenario: VFS is disabled by default
        Given user "Alice" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
        Then VFS enabled baseline image should not match the default screenshot


    Scenario: Disable VFS
        Given user "Alice" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
        And the user has enabled virtual file support
        When the user disables virtual file support
        Then the "Enable virtual file support (experimental)..." button should be available
