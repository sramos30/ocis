Enhancement: Display the information state in case we encountered ignored errors

If syncing a file fails multiple times we mark it as ignored to skip it for a certain amount of time.
If we have ignored files we are not in sync, we now don't display the green icon.

Additionally this change aligns the icon displayed in the system tray with the icon displayed in the app.
