Bugfix: The client no longer idles after a minor url change

When the client detects a change of the url we ask the user to accept
the change or if it was only representational change (demo.com vs demo.com/) we directly accept the change.
Due to a bug the we aborted the sync only after we updated the url.
This caused the client to idle for one minute.
