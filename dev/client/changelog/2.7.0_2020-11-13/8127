Change: Remove update channels from the ownCloud client

To ensure a maximum of stability user should not replace their productive client with a preview build.
For that exact reason we offer tespilotcloud clients, they can be installed in parallel and updated via the beta channel.

If a user is more adventures than the average a manual install of a preview is always possible.
