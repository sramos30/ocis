Change: Support for OpenID Connect

The ownCloud desktop client now supports OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management, when it makes sense for them.

See http://openid.net/connect/faq/ for a set of answers to frequently asked questions about OpenID Connect.
