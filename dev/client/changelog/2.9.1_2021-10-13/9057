Bugfix: When a folder is removed we leave a database behind

We fixed a bug where we left an empty `sync_journal.db` behind, when we removed a folder/account.
As we use the presence of `sync_journal.db` to determine whether the folder is used by a sync client this
prevented using an old folder in a new setup.
